GNH originated in Bhutan in 1970s, when His Majesty the fourth king of Bhutan, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, identified GNH as a core value of the Bhutanese way of life. His Majesty said, "Gross national happiness is more important than gross domestic product." It was officially adopted as a national goal in 2008, and its principles have been enshrined in the country's constitution.
GNH prioritizes the preservation of Bhutan's lush forests, clean rivers, and diverse wildlife. They set a target to maintain at least 60% forest cover and establish protected areas for wildlife. The third pillar of GNH is called "Conservation of the Environment." This pillar highlights the importance of protecting the environment as a core element of happiness and well-being. This way, GNH serves as an example of how a nation can prioritize both the happiness of its people and the health of the planet.
