With a wingspan of around 3-4 centimeters, it showcases brown and orange hues on its wings. These butterflies are known for their rapid and elusive flight patterns. They inhabit diverse environments, including forests, gardens, and open spaces. Their life cycle involves stages of egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult. They likely contribute to pollination as they feed on nectar from flowers, adding to Bhutan's rich insect diversity and playing a role in local ecosystems.</div>

It boasts a wingspan ranging from 6 to 9 centimeters, featuring white wings adorned with bold black veins and patterns, often complemented by blue or iridescent tones. These butterflies inhabit mountainous landscapes, favoring alpine meadows and higher elevations. Their life cycle involves stages of egg, larva, pupa, and adult, with larvae likely feeding on specific plants and adults primarily feeding on flower nectar. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial to protect these impressive butterflies and their habitats in Bhutan</div>

The species was first described by Émile Blanchard in 1853. The Barrow-banded Satyr is a robust Himalayan butterfly, spanning between 55 to 68 mm in wingspan. Its upper wings are black or very dark brown with a distinctive white band crossing both wings. The hindwing band is narrow and uniform in width. The forewings showcase 1 to 4 white discal spots arranged in a line along the inner edge. There's a dark apical spot or ocellus on the forewing. The wings have rounded edges with a convex termen and checkered fringes. Beneath, the hindwings exhibit a dark background with less prominent but beautiful white variegations.</div>

Its underside is a dull whitish color on the forewing, while the hindwing exhibits brown markings in spots, lines, and bands, some nearly black. The butterfly's body parts—antennae, head, thorax, and abdomen—are mostly brown, occasionally showing a purplish hue in fresh specimens, with the undersides of the palpi, thorax, and abdomen appearing dingy brownish-white.The female's upper side is predominantly brown. On the forewing, the costal and terminal margins are darker, with a dark basal area and a posterior discal series of dark brown spots. Between these areas, dingy white patches appear. The hindwing displays a series of white spots and inwardly conical very dark brown spots, edged narrowly with white. Both wings have slender black anteciliary lines. The underside is purer white compared to the male, with similar markings but narrower and more distinct. Body parts like antennae, head, thorax, and abdomen are brown, lighter than in males, lacking the purplish tint on the thorax. The undersides of the palpi, thorax, and abdomen are white.</div>
